July 12 Minsk city court sentenced Alyaksandr Kazulin to 5.5 years of imprisonment.
In prison Alyaksandr Kazulin announced a hunger strike, demanding to consider the Belarusian problem in the UN Security Council.
The political prisoner was on hunger strike for 53 days and reduced by more than 40 kilograms. His health has been irreparably damaged.
The courageous politician achieved his aim. A US representative brought up the problem of Belarus in the UN Security Council.
The deputy chairman of the citizenship and migration department Alyaksei Byahun has stated that the conviction of the former political Alyaksandr Kazulin has been removed from official records.
Alyaksandr Kazulin, a politician recently released from a Belarusian prison, met with Lithuanian president Vadlas Adamkus on August 25.
Lithuanian President Valdas Adamkus has met today with former Belarusian political prisoner Alyaksandr Kazulin.
“We are thankful to all people of Belarus who have struggled for our release,” the joint statement to the Belarusian nation of former political prisoners Alyaksandr Kazulin, Syarhei Parsyukevich and Andrei Kim says.
“I personally highly appreciate the decision of the Belarusian authorities on releasing political prisoners. It was absolutely immoral to keep them in prisons,” Belarusian politologist Syarhei Pankouski thinks.
The US Embassy views release of Syarhei Parsyukevich and Andrei Kim an important event, the press-service of the US diplomatic mission has stated. It is expected that a special statement will be made by the US State Department.
It were the economic sanctions imposed by the US against Lukashenka’s regime have made the Belarusian authorities release political prisoners, believes one of the leaders of the civil campaign “European Belarus” Andrei Sannikov.
The oncoming “parliamentary election” will be neither free nor democratic, and real opposition won’t enter the “parliament”. If the election results are rigged, the Belarusians should protest because their votes haven’t been counted.
Alyaksandr Kazulin has been pardoned buy a decree of Alyaksandr Lukashenka, Interfax was informed by Aleh Slyapenka, an interim head of information and PR department of the Interior Minister of Belarus.
Benita Ferrero-Waldner, European Commissioner for External Relations and European Neighbourhood Policy, welcomed release of the oppositional politician Alyaksandr Kazulin and stated that she counts on “immediate release of other Belarusian politicians”.
On August 16, on the Day of Belarusian Solidarirty, the former candidate for presidency in Belarus, a political prisoner Alyakasndr Kazulin, was relsed.

Several rallies dedicated to the Day of Solidarity were held in Minsk on August 16. Activists of the civil campaign “European Belarus” gathered in the streets of the city with portraits of political prisoners and abducted leaders of the opposition.
The press-service of Alyaksandr Kazulin has distributed a press-release on the occasion of the politician’s release.
On August 11 the head of the OSCE office in Minsk Hans Jochen Schmidt visited Alyaksandr Kazulin in the colony Vitsba-3. It is not reported about the topics they discussed.
The US is not going to cancel the economic sanctions against the Belarusian enterprises if political prisoners Alyaksandr Kazulin, Syarhei Parsyukevich and Andrei Kim are not released. It has been stated today at a press-conference in Minsk by US Charge d'Affaires Jonathan Moore.
“Initially the BSDP (H) congress was prepared as a technical one. It was stated everywhere that it was connected with the so-called “parliamentary elections”.
But finally a new leader was elected. It’s immoral, it is an awful political mistake, and it contradicts common sense,” told a deputy chairman of the Belarusian Social Democratic party (Hramda) Ihar Rynkevich in an interview to the Charter’97 press-centre.
In an interview to the Charter’97 press-centre a daughter of the political prisoner Alyaksandr Kazulin slammed the decision of the Belarusian Social Democratic party (Hramada) about re-election of the party chairman.
A call “Freedom for Kazulin!” is on the agenda in Belarus and in the world, but party colleagues of the political prisoners interpret this call in another way and removed Alyaksandr Kazulin from the post of leader of the Belarusian Social Democratic Party (Hramada).
Coordinators of the public commission “Freedom to Kazulin and all political prisoners of Belarus!” Volha Kazulina and Raisa Mikhailouskaya were in the United States on an invitation of the US Department of State from 20 to 27 July.

Riot militia officers forced participants of the solidarity action out of October Square in Minsk on 16 May.
People came to the square demanding to release political prisoners.
Today democratic forces activists mark the Day of Solidarity in Minsk.
They are going to come to October Square with portraits of political prisoners at 6.00pm.

Former presidential candidate Alyaksandr Kazulin has a meeting in the penal colony Vitsba-3 with his daughters Volha and Yulya on 3 May.
Lukashenka’s statements he said during his address to the “parliament” on 29 April may become a ground for legal process.
The most awful thing I have heard is that my father was called a person who had nothing sacred for him.
Alyaksandr Lukashenka gave the “national assembly” his traditional “annual address.” The Belarusian head of state didn’t say anything new. Most of the statements have been already heard before.

English (language) definition of English (language) in the Free Online Encyclopedia.
Spoken by about 470 million people throughout the world, English is the official language of about 45 nations.
It is the mother tongue of about 60 million persons in the British Isles, from where it spread to many other parts of the world owing to British exploring, colonizing, and empire-building from the 17th through 19th cent.
It is now also the first language of an additional 228 million people in the United States; 16.5 million in Canada; 17 million in Australia; 3 million in New Zealand and a number of Pacific islands; and approximately 15 million others in different parts of the Western Hemisphere, Africa, and Asia.
As a result of such expansion, English is the most widely scattered of the great speech communities.
It is also the most commonly used auxiliary language in the world.
The United Nations uses English not only as one of its official languages but also as one of its two working languages.
Today's English is the continuation of the language of the 5th-century Germanic invaders of Britain.
No records exist of preinvasion forms of the language.
The language most closely related to English is the West Germanic language Frisian Frisian language, member of the West Germanic group of the Germanic subfamily of the Indo-European family of languages (see Germanic languages ).
), and Modern English; this division implies no discontinuity, for even the hegemony of French affected only a small percentage of the population. The English-speaking areas have expanded at all periods.
Before the Normans the language was spoken in England and S Scotland, but not in Cornwall, Wales, or, at first, in Strathclyde. English has not completely ousted the Celtic languages Celtic languages, subfamily of the Indo-European family of languages.

from the British Isles, but it has spread vastly overseas.
Like other languages, English has changed greatly, albeit imperceptibly, so that an English speaker of 1300 would not have understood the English of 500 nor the English of today.
Changes of every sort have taken place concomitantly in the sounds (phonetics), in their distribution (phonemics), and in the grammar (morphology and syntax).
The following familiar words show changes of 1,000 years: The changes are more radical than they appear, for Modern English ō and ā are diphthongs. The words home, stones, and name exemplify the fate of unaccented vowels, which became ə, then ə disappeared.
In Old English important inflectional contrasts depended upon the difference between unaccented vowels; so, as these vowels coalesced into ə and this disappeared, much of the case system disappeared too.
In Modern English a different technique, word order (subject + predicate + object), is used to show what a case contrast once did, namely, which is the actor and which the goal of the action.

English civil war, 1642–48, the conflict between King Charles I Charles I, 1600–1649, king of England, Scotland, and Ireland (1625–49), second son of James I and Anne of Denmark.
of England and a large body of his subjects, generally called the "parliamentarians," that culminated in the defeat and execution of the king and the establishment of a republican commonwealth Commonwealth in English history was the government set up by the victorious army power following the English civil war and the execution (1649) of King Charles I.
Parliament in this period did not represent the full body of the English people; it was composed of and represented the nobility, country gentry, and merchants and artisans. The 16th cent.
had seen a decline in the influence of the nobility and a striking rise in the numbers, wealth, and influence of the gentry and merchants, the beneficiaries of a tremendous expansion of markets and trade in Tudor times. It was from this middle class of gentry and merchants that the opposition to the crown drew most of its members.
The Parliament that met in 1604 soon clashed with the king on questions of finance and supply. James was forced to temporize because of his urgent need of money, but the dissolution of the Parliament in 1610 left feelings of bitterness on both sides.
A new Parliament met in 1614, and the Commons engaged in quarrels not only with the king but also with the House of Lords. Because it passed not a single statute, this was called the Addled Parliament.
Charles I, married to a French Roman Catholic princess, Henrietta Maria, proved more intractable and even less acceptable to the Puritan taste than his father, and Parliament became even more uncompromising in the new reign.
The leaders of the parliamentary party—Coke, John Pym Pym, John (pĭm), 1583?–1643, English statesman.

, and John Selden Selden, John, 1584–1654, English jurist and scholar.
He studied at Oxford, was called to the bar in 1612, and was elected to Parliament in 1623.
Failing to raise money without Parliament, he was forced to call a new one in 1628.
The new Parliament drew up the Petition of Right Petition of Right, 1628, a statement of civil liberties sent by the English Parliament to Charles I .
, and Charles accepted it in order to get his subsidy. He continued to levy customs duties, an act that the parliamentarians declared illegal under the Petition of Right.
Parliament in 1629 vigorously protested Charles's collection of tonnage and poundage and the prosecution of his opponents in the Star Chamber Star Chamber, ancient meeting place of the king of England's councilors in the palace of Westminster in London, so called because of stars painted on the ceiling.
In the succeeding 11 years Charles attempted to rule without a Parliament, resorting to such expedients as ship money (a tax levied originally on seaports but extended by Charles to the entire country) to raise revenue.

Charles's chief advisers, Archbishop William Laud Laud, William, 1573–1645, archbishop of Canterbury (1633–45). He studied at St. John's College, Oxford, and was ordained a priest in 1601.
The disasters of the second Scottish war compelled a virtual surrender by the king to the opposition, and the Long Parliament was summoned (Nov., 1640). The parliamentarians quickly enacted a series of measures designed to sweep away what they regarded as the encroachments of despotic monarchy.
A Triennial Act provided that no more than three years should elapse between sessions of Parliament, while another act prohibited the dissolution of Parliament without its own consent. Ship money and tonnage and poundage without parliamentary authorization were abolished.
Star Chamber and other prerogative and episcopal courts were swept away. However, discussions on church reform along Puritan lines produced considerable disagreement, especially between the Commons and Lords.
Despite the king's compliance to the will of the opposition thus far, he was not trusted by the parliamentary party. This distrust was given sharp focus by the outbreak (Oct., 1641) of a rebellion against English rule in Ireland; an army was needed to suppress the rebellion, but the parliamentarians feared that the king might use it against them.
Led by John Pym, Parliament adopted the Grand Remonstrance, reciting the evils of Charles's reign and demanding church reform and parliamentary control over the army and over the appointment of royal ministers.
The radicalism of these demands split the parliamentary party and drove many of the moderates to the royalist side.
This encouraged Charles to assert himself, and in Jan., 1642, he attempted to arrest in person Pym and four other leaders of the opposition in Commons. His action made civil war inevitable.
In the lull that followed, both Parliament and the king sought to secure fortresses, arsenals, and popular support.
In June, 1642, Parliament sent to the king a statement reiterating the demands of the Grand Remonstrance, but since the proposals amounted to a complete surrender of sovereignty by the crown to Parliament, the king did not even consider them as a basis for discussion.
Armed forces (including many peers from the House of Lords and a sizable minority of Commons) gathered about him in the north.
Parliament organized its own army and appointed Robert Devereux, 3d earl of Essex Essex, Robert Devereux, 3d earl of, 1591–1646, English parliamentary general; son of the 2d earl.
, to head it. On Aug. 22, 1642, Charles raised his standard at Nottingham.
The first major engagement of the armies at Edgehill (Oct. 23, 1642) was a drawn battle. Charles then established himself at Oxford.
The royalist forces gained ground in the north and west, although repeated attempts by the king to advance on London proved abortive.
The indecisive engagements of 1643 were remarkable mainly for the emergence of Oliver Cromwell Cromwell, Oliver (krŏm`wĕl, krŭm`–, –wəl), 1599–1658, lord protector of England.

, an inconspicuous member of the Long Parliament, to military prominence with his own regiment of "godly" men, soon to become famous as the Ironsides.
Futile negotiations for peace had been conducted at Oxford early in 1643, and in Sept., 1643, Parliament took a decisive step by securing the alliance of the Presbyterian Scots in accepting the Solemn League and Covenant.
The war now entered a new phase.
, advanced into Yorkshire early in 1644 and gave aid to the parliamentary army in the north.
Charles's nephew, the brilliant and dashing Prince Rupert Rupert, Prince, 1619–82, count palatine of the Rhine.
, did something to stem royalist losses by retaking Newark, but his gains were temporary.
His campaign to relieve the besieged York led to the battle of Marston Moor (July 2, 1644), in which Cromwell and Leslie inflicted a crushing defeat on the royalists. Charles managed to cut off Essex in the southwest but shortly thereafter met parliamentary troops from the north in an indecisive engagement at Newbury.
To stem the rising dissension among parliamentary leaders, Cromwell sponsored in Parliament the Self-Denying Ordinance, by which all members of Parliament were compelled to resign their commands, and the parliamentary army was reorganized (1644–45) into the New Model Army.
Thomas Fairfax (later 3d Baron Fairfax of Cameron Fairfax of Cameron, Thomas Fairfax, 3d Baron, 1612–71, English general.

, moved north and stormed Leicester. He met Cromwell in a sharp battle at Naseby (June 14, 1645).
This battle cost the king a large part of his army and rendered the royalist cause hopeless.
Unable to join Montrose (who was defeated by Leslie in Scotland) and thwarted in his attempts to secure aid from Ireland or the Continent, the king was unable to halt the steady losses of his party and finally was compelled to surrender himself to the Scots, who made him reassuring but vague promises. The first civil war came to an end when Oxford surrendered in June, 1646.
The king was delivered (1647) by the Scots into the hands of Parliament, but the Presbyterian rule in that body had thoroughly alienated the army.
The army resisted Parliament's proposal to disband it by capturing the king from the parliamentary party and marching on London.
Army discontent gradually became more radical (see Levelers Levelers or Levellers, English Puritan sect active at the time of the English civil war . The name was apparently applied to them in 1647, in derision of their beliefs in equality.
Refusing to accept the army council's proposals for peace (the Heads of the Proposals), Charles escaped in Nov., 1647, and took refuge on the Isle of Wight, where he negotiated simultaneously with Parliament and the Scots. In Dec., 1647, he concluded an agreement with the Scots known as the Engagement, by which he agreed to accept Presbyterianism in return for military support.
Parliament again tried to reach some agreement with the king, but the army, now completely under Cromwell's domination, disposed of its enemies in Parliament by Pride's Purge (Dec., 1648; see under Pride, Thomas Pride's Purge, expelling from Parliament 143 members (mostly Presbyterians) on the ground that they were royalist sympathizers.
The remaining Rump Parliament, completely under army control, then arranged the trial of Charles I.

Following the English civil war and the execution of Charles I, England was declared (1649) a commonwealth under the rule of the Rump Parliament.
It ended in 1660 with the Restoration Restoration, in English history, the reestablishment of the monarchy on the accession (1660) of Charles II after the collapse of the Commonwealth (see under commonwealth ) and the Protectorate .
Although some of the changes brought about by the war were swept away (e.g., in the restoration of Anglicanism as the state church), the settlement of the contest between the king and Parliament was permanently assured in the Glorious Revolution Glorious Revolution, in English history, the events of 1688–89 that resulted in the deposition of James II and the accession of William III and Mary II to the English throne.

He has very interesting things to say about the reworkings of the representation of Overbury, but he does not have the space to provide the depth of analysis of the earlier parts of the book; his attempt to show an indirect link between Jacobean court scandal and the English Revolution is not so fully worked out, and he slightly glosses over the problem that between Jacobean moral court scandal and the 1640s lay the undoubtedly moral Caroline court.
The leaders of the American Revolution were heartened by the fact that there had been an English revolution that had succeeded.

Caxton's achievement encouraged writing of all kinds and also influenced the standardization of the English language.
The early Tudor period, particularly the reign of Henry VIII, was marked by a break with the Roman Catholic Church and a weakening of feudal ties, which brought about a vast increase in the power of the monarchy.
Stronger political relationships with the Continent were also developed, increasing England's exposure to Renaissance culture.
Humanism became the most important force in English literary and intellectual life, both in its narrow sense—the study and imitation of the Latin classics—and in its broad sense—the affirmation of the secular, in addition to the otherworldly, concerns of people.
These forces produced during the reign (1558–1603) of Elizabeth I one of the most fruitful eras in literary history.
Elizabethan literature generally reflects the exuberant self-confidence of a nation expanding its powers, increasing its wealth, and thus keeping at bay its serious social and religious problems.
Disillusion and pessimism followed, however, during the unstable reign of James I (1603–25). The 17th cent.
was to be a time of great upheaval—revolution and regicide, restoration of the monarchy, and, finally, the victory of Parliament, landed Protestantism, and the moneyed interests.

It’s the last month of the year… time to look back on this year and time to embrace the new one.
We hope that all of you had a closer look at MyHeritage by now and embraced some of the nice features there, like the quite helpful photo organisation based on face recognition or the wide range of genealogy tools .
Let us know if you have any questions, feedback, suggestions for improvement or other wishes.
The first time we met Gilad, the founder and CEO of Myheritage, was in early 2007 – a few weeks before we released the first public version of Kindo. Gareth and me were invited to have lunch with him in Soho in central London, and went there with the objective of learning everything we could about the “enemy”.
But there we were: A Swede, a South African and an Israeli, all with very different professional background and life stories, talking about the future of families online from very different perspectives.
I didn’t expect this, but we found that we had much in common.
As Gareth and I travelled back on the tube, we talked about how nice it would be to be able to offer our own users the same tools as MyHeritage already had. What really got us excited was their SmartMatching Technology, which matches people in your family tree with 250 Million other names, and suggests who you might be related too.
During this summer, we’ve been thinking long and hard about the future of Kindo, and what the best option would be for taking Kindo to the next level.
So we join the MyHeritage family because we share the same vision and values (as families should), and because we think that we can build an amazing product together – bringing real benefits to families around the world.
This is what we’re planning to do over the next years.
Today, we have the devoted genealogist Anna-Karin from Sweden as a guest-writer on the Kindo blog.
As some of you may have experienced, some of your family trees are not loading properly at the moment. We apologize for the inconvenience and hope to be up and running shortly!
Everyone hits a brick wall in genealogy, where the birth and death records just aren’t easy to find. In that case, try some different records.
Deeds often contain information on who sold what to whom; who inherited what from whom; or how some land was divided among a family. Historic tax records on land also sometimes have interesting information, such as co-ownership.
It’s only August and the weekend offered us some nice sunshine and t-shirt weather.
Still, the sun is starting to set earlier and is a reminder about the season that will soon be upon us.
Just as the squirrels and different kinds of birds collect nuts and seeds, someone in the Kindo office seems to be doing some really solid forward planning.
Judging from this picture - it’s going to be a looong winter.
As I point out in my book, Genealogy Online 8th Edition , you can do a lot of good research using search engines and Boolean operators (AND, NOT, OR, and parentheses. ) Recently, Yahoo!
Most beginners to genealogy are fuzzy about cousinship.
For example, while many understand first cousins are people with common grandparents, many folks confuse first cousin once removed and second cousin.
Showing degrees of relationship by blood.
“Using DNA is one of the newest and latest tools of tracing your genealogy, and it’s remarkable,” said Wells, who represented Family Tree DNA .”You can see if they migrated, you can find out more about your great-aunt and maybe she acted strangely, but that was because she had a baby die at childbirth … you just never know what secrets the past will reveal,” Wells said.
We all know that because of paper trails for genealogical lines usually stopping in the late 1700s or early 1800s, because of spelling changes and fires in courthouses or libraries… it is hard to find relatives.
But DNA helps discover previously unknown kinships, identify errors in paper form and as a result makes research easier.
After obtaining samples and finding a reliable testing company, it takes between almost a month and a half to get the results, it means a string of numbers that you’ll have to read and compare. Some group of administrator also exist to help you analyze results.
-First it does not replace paper documentation since it does not name common ancestors, it is more a tool to prove lineage. Several companies, like Family Tree DNA, can assist you to confirm your family tree or allow you to determine whether two people are related if you give them DNA of someone.
- It’s less reffective for females to use DNA than for males because thanks to Y-DNA, we can determine paternal and maternal lines, whereas for females it is just maternal.
